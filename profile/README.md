# Polyglot

**Build fast. Deploy faster.**

Welcome to Polyglot – a collection of modern development tools designed to eliminate friction from your workflow. We're building the tools we wish we had: intelligent project scaffolding, batteries-included web stacks, and libraries that just work.

## Our Projects

### 🚀 [Polyglot](https://github.com/polyglot-build/polyglot)

Intelligent project scaffolding that goes beyond simple file copying. Polyglot creates fully reproducible development environments with version-pinned tools, orchestrated services, and concurrent task execution.

**Key Features:**
- **Reproducible by default** – Every project works the same way on every machine
- **Declarative setup** – Define your entire stack in a clean `pack.yaml` manifest
- **Concurrent orchestration** – Tasks run in parallel with automatic dependency resolution
- **Composable blueprints** – Mix and match reusable components across projects
- **Service management** – Built-in Docker services with health checks

Perfect for teams who want consistent, reliable project setup without the hassle.

### ⚡ [Greyhound](https://github.com/polyglot-build/greyhound)

An opinionated, batteries-included web stack that gets you from idea to deployed application in minutes. Greyhound combines Go's performance with modern frontend tooling to create a seamless full-stack experience.

**Key Features:**
- **Single binary deployment** – Compile everything into one executable
- **Go + Inertia.js** – Server-driven SPAs without the API complexity
- **Vite + Tailwind** – Modern frontend with instant hot reload
- **SQLite or Postgres** – Choose your database based on your scale
- **Built-in essentials** – Auth, jobs, migrations, and health checks included
- **One-command deploy** – From code to production in seconds

Perfect for dashboards, internal tools, and any web application where shipping fast matters.

## Supporting Libraries

### 📦 [Pack Registry](https://github.com/polyglot-build/pack-registry)
A self-hosted service for discovering and serving versioned Polyglot packs. Integrates with GitHub to automatically index new pack versions.

### 🔗 [Inertia-Greyhound](https://github.com/polyglot-build/inertia-greyhound)
A feature-rich Go adapter for Inertia.js with support for SSR, partial reloads, lazy loading, and more.

A flexible Go library for rendering project templates from any filesystem source using Pongo2.

## Project Status

Both **Polyglot** and **Greyhound** are under active development with beta releases planned before the end of 2024. We're working hard to deliver stable, production-ready tools that will transform how you build and deploy applications.

## Philosophy

We believe development tools should be:
- **Simple to start** – Great defaults that work out of the box
- **Powerful to master** – Deep features when you need them
- **Reliable everywhere** – Reproducible environments, no surprises
- **Fast to deploy** – From local development to production in seconds
